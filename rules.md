# Rules

## Basis

You use 10-sided dices.
If your result is 10, you reroll and add it.
You roll Trait + Skill number of dices against a Target Number (TN).
You keep Trait dices.
For example: You make an Agility + Iaijutsu roll to check if you hit an opponent.
You have 3 in Agility, and 2 in Iaijutsu.
You roll 3+2=5 10-sided dices against a TN of 15.
Your result: 1, 9, 4, 6, 18 (10+8)
You keep 3 dices and add them up to.
Your result is 18 + 9 + 6 = 33 against 15.
You are succesful at hitting your opponent.

## Duel

The duel takes place in two times.
First, the two samurais take their stance and stand in front of each other.
They try to evaluate their opponent.
If they decidde to continue, they wait for the perfect moment to draw their sword and hit their opponent.


## Stance
Both samurais stands in front of each other.
Either or both may make an Awareness + Iaijutsu roll with a TN of 15.
If the roll is successful, they may determine one of three facts:
- The Agility of their opponent;
- The Iaijutsu; or
- The Void
Contestants may raise this TN (Target Number).
For every Raise, they can discover another fact.
The TN max is 25.

After this roll, but before any other action, either opponent may declare his opponent the victor.

If one opponent does not disengage, the duel proceeds to the next stage.

## Focus

The TN for a bushi to strike his opponent is 5.
The bushi with the highest Reflexes announces "Strike" or "Focus".
If Reflexes is tied, then consult Iaijutsu, then Void.
If the first opponent chooses Focus, he Raises the TN by 5.
Second opponent can also choose Focus or Strike.
If he focuses, he raises the current TN by 5, making it 15.
Focusing continues until one opponent announces "Strike".

## Strike

When a duelist announces "Strike":
- his opponent strikes and rolls his Agility + Iaijutsu.
- TN is the last he Raised to.

If the attacker rolls under the TN, he misses.
If he hits but doesn't kill, his opponent can now strike.
The second duelist rolls his attack at the last TN he Raised to (meaning 5 point lower than his opponent's TN).

Duelist may not Raise more times than his Void.
Duelist may spend Void Points before you roll your attack dice.
